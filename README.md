# JJROCKET_SIMULATIONS
Simulations within jjrocket

This repository is of a Java Eclipse project. It is an attempt to simulate a rockets translation and rotation under various scenarios.
In particular, we have been trying to simulate the effects of a new method for stabilizing/guiding the small rocket.

This program uses Java-3d and so you will need the appropriate DLL/JAR's for your operating system which can be downloaded from:-
